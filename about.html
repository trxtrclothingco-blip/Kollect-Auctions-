  <h1>About Kollect Auctions</h1>
  <p> Kollect Auctions was born from a lifelong obsession with collecting.

From a young age, founder Peter James, known as PJ to friends and family, has always been drawn to the thrill of finding, owning, and preserving unique items. What started as a childhood passion never faded; it grew stronger into adulthood, evolving into a deep appreciation for the stories, value, and communities behind collectibles.

That passion is what led PJ to personally design, build, and code Kollect Auctions from the ground up. Frustrated by impersonal platforms, high fees, and a lack of collector-first thinking, he set out to create something different, a place built by a collector, for collectors.

Kollect Auctions is more than just a marketplace. It’s a space where collectors can share, buy, and sell items they genuinely care about, connect with like-minded people, and trust that the platform understands what collecting really means. Every feature has been built with transparency, fairness, and community at its core.

The mission is simple: to become the go-to destination for collectors, whether you’re just starting out or have been collecting for decades.

Welcome to Kollect Auctions where passion meets purpose.
